# shortcuts
This contains a library of all the shortcuts that I use with any software/anything computer or coding related.

# Goal
My goal for this repository is to create a better workflow to save time and optimize the time that I spend working on something. I have a very bad memory, and I don't want to continue to have to look things up over and over again in Google and on Stack Overflow.

# Contents
This will contain keyboard shortcuts that I frequently use on various text editors, browsers, and other software (Paraview would be great). I will also include functions, tables of options, colors, and commands, and other items that I can reuse when visualizing, organizing, and processing data, or for any task really. I'm looking to avoid looking up how to use MatplotLib every 6 months and struggle to rewrite code that I have written before.

# Progress
As of 11/6/2021, this repository contains - nothing! I just created this :).
